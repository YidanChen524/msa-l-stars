# Extended Approximation Algorithms
Extended approximation algorithms for multiple sequence alignment based on l-star method.

## Introduction
- what is multiple sequence alignment and what are our goal?
- Exact Algorithm.
- Approximation Algorithms.

## L-star methods

### Definitions
- What is it?
- How to compute an alignment based on l-star?
- How and why it can be used to find the optimal alignment with an approximation ratio of 2-l/k

### L-stars with dynamic programming
- l = 2, 3
- Typical Dynamic programming
- Optimization

### (2l-1)-stars
- l = 2, 3
- generate random l-star for each center
- calculate score for each pair
- solve the matching problem
- return the best l-star and best alignment

### random sampling


## Implementation
## Experiments
## Conclusion

# To Do
- wrap up and take notes

# Questions:
- only consider where (k-1)|(l-1)
